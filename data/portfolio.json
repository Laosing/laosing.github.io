From a simple request from my partner to make the game show the bomb timer came an incredibly fun journey into learning websockets.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/bombparty/lobby.jpg' /><h4>The journey</h4><p>From a simple timer counting down to a full fledged game that has sound effects, bombs, confetti, and awesome avatars. Features and stability credits go to my colleagues at Fuze who helped play test and came up with multiple ideas that helped make the game more interesting.</p><h4>The architecture</h4><p>The game was created using node.js, express and socket.io; It features real time private rooms, chat, confetti, a scoreboard, hardmode, bonus heart/letter rewards, random name and avatar generators. The dictionaries used are sowpods, enable1 and custom additions such as countries, months and days of the week. There's also a hidden feature that allows you to become an \"admin\" where you can kick other players (clicking on the ðŸ¤¯).</p><p>Give the game a try! I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed building it.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/bombparty/game-active.jpg' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/bombparty/winner.jpg' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/bombparty/darkmode.jpg' />"

After multiple designs and iterations I came with the solution to guide the user with arrows throughout the sections.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/enduser/end-user-wireframe.png' /><h4>Final Design</h4><p>After finalizing the user flow and making some final decisions with the team, I began on the high-fidelity designs. We had many different mockups and iterations. Everything was placed intentionality with good reasoning and decision making behind it. There were a lot of tradeoffs due to the amount of space that could be placed on a page, but that restriction also helped us condense the information so it was straight to the point.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/enduser/end-user-1.jpg' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/enduser/end-user-2.jpg' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/enduser/end-user-3.jpg' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/enduser/end-user-4.jpg' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/enduser/end-user-5.jpg' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/enduser/end-user-6.jpg' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/enduser/end-user-7.jpg' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/enduser/end-user-8.jpg' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/enduser/end-user-9.jpg' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/enduser/end-user-10.jpg' />"

Providing a tool that allows them to interact with the content will allow them to gain higher satisfaction and a more memorable experience throughout the museum.</p><h4>Wireframing concepts</h4><p>I sketched and mocked up basic wireframe concepts to figure out elements such as navigation and layout. I wanted a simple, visual representation of the information so that it was easy to understand. From letting other students run through the wireframes I noticed that the flow was not as intuitive as I originally thought. This feedback helped tremendously to ensure I fixed the issues and continue in the right direction.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/rom/rom-sketch1.jpg' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/rom/rom-sketch2.jpg' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/rom/rom-wireframe.jpg' /><h4>Final design</h4><p>ROM bridges the gap between students and content so that they can interact with history, gain a deeper understanding to the pieces, and improve the overall experience of the museum.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/rom/rom-1.png' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/rom/rom-2.png' /><img class='lazy' data-original='/dist/img/rom/rom-3.png' /><div class='vimeo-video' data-src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/154429844?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0' data-height='441'></div>"
