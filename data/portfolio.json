That little icon, despite the trends  that come and go, and despite the number of design changes that a product goes through, the logo will likely remain unchanged. <br /><br />This is a project with the objective of creating a brand for the headphone market.</em></p><hr /><h4>Research</h4><p>The brand is called BearBeats. It is a brand that creates cool innovative headphones. The mission statement of the brand is to symbolize youth and rebellion, to inspire and empower people through sound’s endless energy, emotion and excitement. <p> The target market is aimed at high school students, who are aged between 13 to 19 years old. The brand’s target culture are young teens who want to stand out and have a high energy attitude, are very passionate about their music and very passionate about their lifestyle.</p><p>The competitive advantage BearBeats has over competitors is that it focuses on being a cool innovative brand that creates great products that produce more interesting and immersive audio experiences. </p><p>Core values are the standard operating principles that guide an organization’s culture, the values BearBeats have are: Focus on the user, embrace and drive change, be fun and a little weird, be adventurous, creative, and open-minded, pursue growth and learning, be passionate and determined. </p><p>Competitors will consist mainly of existing headphone brands in the market such as: Skullcandy, Plantronics, Creative, Philips, Sony, Panasonic, Bose, Apple, JVC, AKG, Sennheiser, Klipsch, Grado and Shure. </p><p>According to a survey about the top 10 coolest brands among more than 1,100 teens aged between 13 and 17. The most-cool brand was YouTube. Then came Netflix, Google, Xbox, Oreos, GoPro, PlayStation, Doritos, and Nike, Chrome. These brands are the inspiration that BearBeats looks up to not because they are the most popular in their industry but because their brand image resonates the strongest with their customers.</p><h4>Development</h4><p>I started sketching to get ideas out of my head and onto paper. I initially wanted to go with music notes because this brand is based around headphones and music, but I noticed a stronger iconographic image could be based around an image of a bear.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='img/bearbeats/bearbeats_05.png' /><h4>Final Design</h4><p>The logotype that was chosen was Lato, because it is a humanist sans serif typeface. It is modern yet has a hint of playfulness because of the semi-rounded details of the letters. This helps BearBeats target it’s audience of teens 13 to 19 years old. Making the typeface bold adds stability and seriousness to the feel of the logotype. </p><p>The signatures BearBeats uses are whitespace in between the text and icon that is a quarter the height of the logo for the horizontal layout, and similarly for the vertical layout when the icon is on top of the text. </p><p>The colour combination of red and black was used for the final logo because red is the color of fire and blood, so it is associated with energy, war, danger, strength, power, determination as well as passion, desire, and love. Red is a very emotionally intense color. This is the target culture and core values that BearBeats is aiming for; high energy attitude, and very passionate people. The colour used is called Raging Red, to show the strong passion of consumers, the web version will use the RGB 249 66 58, while the print version will use CMYK 0 83 80 0.  The logo is coloured in a way that the red headphones jump out at the viewer, along with the “Beats” in the icon to inform viewers that this brand is about music and sound. The two colours in the logo have meaning as the black “Bear” is related to the black icon of the bear, likewise the red “Beats” is related to the red headphones.</p><p>The icon is symbolic towards a user listening to music. The reason why a bear was used as a representation of a user is because bears represents wisdom, strength and leadership. Bears have been worshiped throughout time as a powerful totem, inspiring those who need it the courage to stand up against adversity. Additionally the icon has many elements that scale along multiples of the golden ratio (1.618) such as the overall size, to the head of the bear, to the mouth and finally to the eyes. The style of the headphones were specifically made so that in the single colour version, they could still be identified even though the parts of it become absorbed into the bear’s head.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='img/bearbeats/bearbeats_07.png' /><img class='lazy' data-original='img/bearbeats/bearbeats_02.png' /><img class='lazy' data-original='img/bearbeats/bearbeats_09.png' /><img class='lazy' data-original='img/bearbeats/bearbeats_08.png' />",

Well forget about the hassle of getting up and putting your book away on the shelf because now there is a an organizer specifically for that. For this project I designed a bedside organizer for books and utilities.</em></p><hr /><h4>Research</h4><p>To start off this project I decided to create a quick online survey to see how many users would be interested in a portable bedside table, as well as to find out about their book reading and storing habits. I posted this survey through social media and quickly got 41 participants. I was surprised to see that 68% of participants would be interested in a portable bedside table even though 93% already have a table. This helped give me an incentive to design a solution for this. I further inquired about how many, what kind, and what size the books that users had. This data helped guide my design decisions to make a product users would need.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='img/organizer/organizer_05.png' /><img class='lazy' data-original='img/organizer/organizer_02.png' /><h4>Development</h4><p>My idea was to create a portable table that is first and foremost small and lightweight. I focused on making it easy for users to use. During the concept development I utilized the results from my survey to guide many of my design decisions. Along with that I looked into different bed attachment methods, placement of the table platform, the number of book holders, and materials. I explored ideas through sketching and low fidelity mock-ups.</p><h4>Final Design</h4><p>My final design is a portable bedside table for books that is small enough to be taken anywhere. It is also designed to work with every existing bed out there. This versatile table was created to hold books or accessories where there is no table or table space available.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='img/organizer/organizer_06.png' /><img class='lazy' data-original='img/organizer/organizer_04.png' /><img class='lazy' data-original='img/organizer/organizer_15.png' />",

They focus on producing high-quality luxury vehicles that appeal to customers globally. They are a British multinational car manufacturer that focuses on stimulating emotions and feelings to their customers. <p>Our research found that the target audience of Jaguar consists mainly of wealthy middle aged professionals and executives, but they are attempting to attract potential millennial luxury customers.</p><p>Jaguars’ have a DNA that is instantly recognizable across their car range.

With the main feature of supporting multiple user food preparation scenarios.</em></p><hr /><h4>Research</h4><p>In our current system of production and consumption, products are designed, manufactured and consumed within a short period of time. These disposed products end up in landfills and is having a major negative effect on the environment as over 71,000 tonnes of e-waste has been tossed in 2012.<a href=\"http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/16-002-x/2016001/article/14570-eng.htm\">[1]</a> For electronic kitchen appliances, specialized products are designed for each and every function such as grilling, warming-up, steam cooking, slow cooking, frying, and etc. In response to this, a new approach is needed to develop more flexible and adaptable solutions for products that lessen their impact on the environment.</p> <p>My aim was to create a portable cooking platform specially designed to be portable and lightweight, used in offices without a kitchen, dorms, homes or outdoors where an easily transportable means of cooking or heating is needed. The goal is for a platform that can be used in diverse situations, such as for office food servicing and catering generally in locations where a full kitchen stove would not be convenient or practical.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='img/cooking_platform/cooking_platform_14.png' /><p>Through research, I wanted to gain a better understanding of the experiences of multi user kitchen environments, their wants and needs, as well as the solutions currently available for them. By understanding my targeted users, I can design my product with solutions specifically targeted to their needs.</p><p>The first step of my research was to look at existing situations of multi tool kitchenware appliances and what products are currently on the market. From these products I discovered an insight that the range of cooking applications with these appliances are limited to certain types of cooking and that many of them provide every tool in the box when purchased. This allowed me to focus my design so that it would function with a wider range of cooking processes, while also thinking of methods I could use to provide only the components that users would need.</p><h4>Development</h4><p>My idea was to design a cooking platform that is first and foremost portable and lightweight, and then focus on ways to make the it more personal to the user. During the concept development, I looked into different attachment methods, placement on the main body, the interface, the use cycle and material aesthetics. I explored ideas through sketching and low fidelity mock-ups.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='img/cooking_platform/cooking_platform_14.png' /><h4>User Testing</h4><p>My goal for user testing was to test my ideas and low fidelity prototypes on users to have a greater understanding of potential problems with my designs and areas of improvement. For my testing, I had three main investigation questions:</p><img class='lazy' data-original='img/cooking_platform/cooking_platform_07.png' /><h4>Final Design</h4><p>After several interface discussions with users I decided to incorporate the entire control interface on the large control knob. This makes it so that the base of the product can be as portable as possible, while also ensuring that the interface has only essential elements for users to understand what settings it is currently on.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='img/cooking_platform/cooking_platform_12.png' /><img class='lazy' data-original='img/cooking_platform/cooking_platform_09.png' /><img class='lazy' data-original='img/cooking_platform/cooking_platform_19.png' />",

Packages not only communicate the features of that product, but also communicate its brand, lifestyle, and quality. <br /><br />This is a project with the objective of taking a brand and developing a package for an industry outside of that specific brand. My goal was to brand Nivia cookies.</em></p><hr /><h4>Research</h4><p>Nivea is a German personal care brand that specializes in body-care initially started in 1911. It is owned by the Hamburg-based company Beiersdorf Global AG. Nivea stands for closeness, trust, quality and effective skin care products for all skin types on a global level. Family values are also an important aspect of its brand character. As a brand that nurtures and protects, its strong heritage helps to maintain its market leadership in over 46 countries. Nivea has products that meet all skin needs, such as anti-aging, lip balms, deodorants, shaving, sun lotions, hand creams and shower products. </p><p>The target market for NIVEA women is aged 18-35. They have middle to high income and they are self-empowered. They take care of their skin well for their own goodness and to boost confidence. They also have product lines that target both men and kids. NIVEA maintains consumer engagement and a blue color code used across brand elements that consumers can easily associate with NIVEA. This ensures quicker brand recognition that gives a competitive advantage in the market. </p><p>Mission statement: We have four core values that guide everything we do at Beiersdorf. These are: Care - To act responsibly towards our colleagues, consumers, brands, our society and our environment. Simplicity - To strive for clarity and consistency, make decisions quickly and pragmatically and focus on what’s essential. Courage - Stay committed to bold objectives, take initiative, learn from our mistakes and see change as an opportunity. Trust - Say what we mean, keep our promises and treat others with respect.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='img/cookiebox/cookiebox_11.png' /><img class='lazy' data-original='img/cookiebox/cookiebox_07.png' /><h4>Development</h4><img class='lazy' data-original='img/cookiebox/cookiebox_04.png' /><h4>Final Design</h4><p>For a Nivea cookie box design I made the entire box one of Nivea’s blues (#00136f) as it will help consumers instantly recognize the brand. For the front design I aligned the most important elements in the center such as the logo, cookie image, product name and description because on many Nivea products the elements and details are aligned to the center of the package. I decided to place the radiating dot pattern to center on the cookies instead of the Nivea logo because I wanted the main focus of the design to be about the cookies. The top is just the Nivea logo as this is consistent with many other Nivea packages. </p><p>Although Nivea rarely duplicates the front imagery for the sides or back of the package, I decided that for a cookie box it is important for cookie details to be placed on both sides. This is because a cookie box may be placed on the shelf in a store in an unintended orientation due to lack of space. So by having the cookie details on both sides, the box can be placed upright or on its sides and the consumer can still tell what the product is. </p><p>On the back of the package I placed the nutritional facts, barcode, ingredients, other details, and parent company information. I placed these elements on the back because of how much space they take up, I decided that both the ingredients and the nutritional facts should be placed together as this information is normally read together by consumers. This is important because consumers check the nutritional values and any food allergies they may have on the same side making it more convenient for them. I stuck to Nivea’s branding language by keeping the layout clean with a consistent margins and spacing around all the elements.</p><img class='lazy' data-original='img/cookiebox/cookiebox_16.png' /><img class='lazy' data-original='img/cookiebox/cookiebox_021.png' />",
